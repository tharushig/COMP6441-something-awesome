            <h1>Excited to learn lockpicking? Let's get straight to it!</h1>
            <p>Here on Lockmaster, you will learn the theory behind picking locks. Since the most common design for locks is the pin-tumbler, this is what we will be focusing on.</p>
            <p>But before we get started, let's get to know a litte more about the lock itself.</p>
            <h2>The workings of a lock</h2>
            <p>Our standard pin-tumbler lock consists of a few different components: the cylinder, the plug, the shear line, key pins, driver pins and the springs.</p>
            <p>The cylinder contains all the lock components and also makes up the top of the shear line.</p>
            <p>The plug is a cylinder that rotates inside the cylinder 'housing' and creates a rotational shear line and the bottom of the shear line. The front of the plug is also where the key is inserted whilst the tailpiece on the back retracts the latch when the lock is rotated. This causes the lock to open.</p>
            <p>The shear line, which is mentioned above, is the gap between the cylinder and the plug and is the imaginary line that the plug rotates around. When the shear line is obstructed, the plug won't be able to turn as the plug and the cylinder become locked onto each other. This makes the lock unable to freely rotate and unable to unlock on free will.</p>
            <p>The key pins are the lower set of pins ans has the purpose of reading the cuts of the key. This is done by using pins of different lengths that match the depth of the cuts of the key.</p>
            <p>The driver pins are the higher set of pins that obstruct the shear line. They are all the same length and determines whether a lock can be opened or not.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the springs are what forces everything down into the plug to keep the driver pins at the shear line when no key is present. They push the key pins against the key to help them read teh cuts and als prvents the pins from getting stuck in the pin chamber.</p>
