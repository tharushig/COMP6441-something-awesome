            <h1>Curious about history? You've come to the right place!</h1>
            <p>Locks were originally knots made out of rope but it is unsure as to who made the first mechanical lock.</p>
            <p>A wooden pin tumbler lock was made in Ancient Eygypt over 6000 years ago but it was not very secure.</p>
            <p>So let's take a look into the slice of history and unlock some information about locks.</p>
            <h2>Joseph Bramah Safety Lock</h2>
            <p>In the 1770s, the 'perfect lock' otherwise known as the Joseph Bramah Safety Lock was created by Joseph Bramah in England.</p>
            <p>The lock required a key to be opened and consisted of complex layers between the key and the deadbolt.</p>
            <p>Bramah had so much confidence in his lock that he offered 200 guineas ($30000) to anyone who was able to pick the lock.</p>

            <h2>Chubb Detector Lock</h2>
            <p>In response to Bramah's contest, the British government wanted a lock that created an alert upon attempted opening. This resulted in Chubb Detector Lock being created by Jeremiah Chubb.</p>
            <p>The key to the lock didn't work if the tumbler was lifted too high, making it unable to open.</p>
            <p>This lock was also thought of as being 'perfectly secure' as no one was able to pick it</p>
            <p>With the Chubb and Bramah locks, there was a period of 'perfect security' lasting from the 1770s until 1851 when the locks were beaten.</p>

            <h2>The End Of a 'Perfectly Secure' Era</h2>
            <p>A.C Hobbs was an American locksmith who sold his own locks and taught bank managers how to pick their locks.</p>
            <p>In 1851, Hobbs was able to pick Chubb's lock in 25 minutes and Brahmah's lock in 52 hours which unfortunately marked the end of 'perfect security'.</p>
            <p>Ever since then, 'perfect security' could never be attained again. But that didn't stop the development of locks.</p>
            <p>Although the pin tumbler lock already existed, Linus Yale Jr mass-produced these and patented it for a variety of uses such as banks, doors and padlocks from 1851 onwards.</p>
            <p>Modern security relies heavily on technology and electrical systems, however, mechanical locks are still used for doors, padlocks and so on.</p>
